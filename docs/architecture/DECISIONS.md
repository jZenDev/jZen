## ADR-007 — Email: the framework sends, the application speaks; identity publishes events

**Date:** 2026-07-21. **Status:** accepted.

### Decision

Four coupled choices for the Step-6 email capability, all following the framework/apps axis
(ADR-001):

1. **`zen-email` is a mechanism, not content.** `EmailService.send(LocalizedEmail)` owns locale
   resolution, per-locale template lookup, rendering, and sending; it owns no wording, no branding,
   and no template. The application supplies the subject (from its own typed Qute
   `@MessageBundle`) and the per-locale bodies under `templates/mail/`. This is the same split as
   TA-1's OpenAPI merge, where a framework resource declares a schema by `$ref` and the app's
   static `META-INF/openapi.yaml` supplies it. The alternative - shipping default templates inside
   the library jar for apps to override - was rejected: a jar-resident Qute template has no clean
   override mechanism, and generic framework branding in a product's mailbox is a defect, not a
   default.

2. **`zen-identity` publishes CDI events; it never sends mail.** `IdentityService.register(...)`
   fires `UserRegistered` and the retention cycle fires `AccountDeletionWarning`; applications
   observe them with `@ObservesAsync`. So `zen-identity` gains **no** dependency on `zen-email`.
   The framework knows *that* a user registered; only the application knows what to say. Both
   events are fired **after** the triggering transaction has committed and are observed
   asynchronously, so mail is never sent for a change that rolled back and registration neither
   waits for SMTP nor can be failed by it. `EmailService.send` compounds that by never throwing: a
   missing template, a render error, or an unreachable relay returns `false` and logs.

3. **`ZenLocales` (in `zen-core`) is the single declaration of the supported set.** `SUPPORTED =
   {en, uk}`, `FALLBACK = en`, with `resolve(tag)` for stored preferences (`users.language`, which
   email reads because it has no request) and `fromAcceptLanguage(header)` delegating to the pure
   `AcceptLanguage` parser. `Accept-Language` on `POST /auth/register` seeds `users.language`; it
   stays a header rather than a `RegisterRequest` field because the locale is a property of the
   request, not of the identity, which leaves the proto contract untouched.

   **On the client the locale is likewise ambient**, supplied once to `ZenClient` as a
   `String Function()?` and emitted on every request beside `X-Request-ID` and `X-Zen-Transport`,
   rather than added as an argument to `registerWithEmail`. A callback, not a value, because the
   locale is live app state and a mid-session language switch must reach the next request; a
   per-call `headers:` entry still overrides it, so `DemoRepository`'s explicit locale is
   unaffected. Making it a repository argument was rejected: it would have changed the
   `IdentityRepository` interface (TA-5 requires the implementation to match it exactly) and every
   fake in the `zen_ui_identity` suite, to express something that is request context rather than
   an endpoint parameter - and it would have fixed only the one endpoint that happens to need it
   today.

4. **Data retention ships now, opt-in, and is never scheduled in prod.** `UserRetentionService` +
   `UserRetentionJob` in `zen-identity` use the `users` GDPR columns the scaffold already carried:
   warn, warn finally, then anonymise. The cron defaults to `off` in the library's own
   `META-INF/microprofile-config.properties` - a framework must never start erasing user data
   because an app depends on it - and `zen_demo_server` enables it in dev only.

   **`%prod` pins it off**, because an in-process cron is incompatible with the deployment model:
   Cloud Run runs `--min-instances=0`, so at 03:00 there is normally no instance alive to fire the
   trigger, and a run that does happen is an accident of traffic rather than a schedule. This is
   the mirror image of the documented "one instance makes in-process state valid" invariant, and
   is now recorded beside it in STANDARDS "Deployment model": in-process *state* is sound under
   this model, in-process *time* is not. The hazard is not merely a missed run - because
   `EmailService` is deliberately non-fatal, an unconfigured SMTP relay would skip the warnings
   while the timestamps advanced, anonymising accounts whose owners were never warned. A product
   that needs retention on Cloud Run drives `runCycle()` from an external trigger (which also wakes
   the instance); that is its own scheduling design and not part of this step, which is why
   `runCycle()` is a plain public method and the cron binding is a thin wrapper over it.

   **This leaves the GDPR obligation undischarged in production, deliberately and on the record.**
   The trigger is specified as **ROADMAP step 7a** (`zen-jobs`), modelled on the donor's
   `../DartZen/packages/dartzen_jobs`: an external scheduler calling one endpoint, job state in
   Postgres, and due-ness computed from `last_run_at` rather than from a timer having fired, so a
   tick missed while scaled to zero is caught up instead of lost. Step 7a also owns the related
   hole this ADR knowingly accepts: because `EmailService` is non-fatal, a warning that failed to
   send still advances the clock toward anonymisation, and gating that needs the durable
   delivery state 7a introduces.

   Windows (330 / 23 / 7 days) are config, and the countdown quoted in a message is derived from
   them, so wording and schedule cannot drift apart.

### What this supersedes, and why

- **"These are defaulted/nullable now and wired in later steps (email deletion warnings in ROADMAP
  step 6 ...)"** (`User` javadoc; BLUEPRINT "Persistence") → **delivered.**
  `deletion_warning_sent_at` / `final_warning_sent_at` are now written by `UserRetentionService`.
  *Why:* the warning emails are the reason the columns exist, and a warning flow with no terminal
  action would promise a deletion that never happens - so the anonymisation step ships with them.
- **"`dartzen_jobs` → Quarkus `@Scheduled`" listed under "port only when a consumer needs them"**
  (ROADMAP Step 7, deferred packages) → **promoted and reframed.** A Quarkus `@Scheduled` bean is
  not a port of `dartzen_jobs` at all: the donor package exists precisely because in-process timers
  do not survive a serverless runtime, and its answer is an external trigger plus persisted job
  state. That work is now **step 7a, required before production rather than deferred**, since the
  GDPR cycle Step 6 delivered cannot legally rely on a timer that may never fire.
- **"`AppMessages` + `AppMessagesUk`"** (BLUEPRINT "Email", localized templates) → **renamed.** The
  reference app's mail subjects are `MailMessages` + `MailMessagesUk`, bundle name `mail`. *Why:* a
  Qute bundle name must be unique per application and `DemoMessages` already holds the default; the
  name now says what the bundle is for.
- **"the two Qute templates at `templates/mail/{warningEmail,finalWarningEmail}.html`" is "what is
  genuinely portable"** (`zen-email/pom.xml` header comment) → **not ported.** The donor templates
  are English-only hardcoded strings; jZen writes six templates instead
  (`{welcome,deletion_warning,final_warning}_{en,uk}.html`). *Why:* STANDARDS forbids carrying the
  donor's limitations forward, and localized-from-the-start is the whole point of the step.
- **The donor's fourth retention phase, deleting unconfirmed identities through the Supabase admin
  API** (`UserCleanupService.deleteUnconfirmedAccounts`) → **not ported.** *Why:* it needs a
  service-role key on the server and reaches into `auth.users`, which jZen deliberately does not
  own (BLUEPRINT "Persistence"). Anonymising the local profile is the part jZen's own schema models.
- **The donor's re-activation bug** (`UserCleanupService.java:143`: a user who signs back in keeps
  their warning stamps and is deleted anyway) → **fixed on port.** `UserStore.upsertOnLogin` clears
  both stamps on every sign-in. *Why:* STANDARDS "Do not carry over donor bugs".

### Consequence

`zen-email` now carries a Jandex index (it contributes a CDI bean, so without one `EmailService`
would be invisible from the jar - the rule that made `zen-transport` the reference).
`UserStore.upsertOnLogin` returns `Upsert(user, created)` so a welcome message is sent once per
profile, never again on a repeat signup. Adding a locale stays a three-file change with no code
edit: a `@Localized` bundle variant, the matching templates, and the tag in `ZenLocales.SUPPORTED`.
Lockstep versioning is unchanged at `0.1.0`.

Verified: `task build:server` and the app build green; the backend suite is **34 tests, 0 failures**
(11 new) - `WelcomeEmailTest` asserts a Ukrainian subject *and* Ukrainian body for
`Accept-Language: uk-UA` and English for none or an unsupported tag, that the header seeds
`users.language`, and that a repeat signup sends nothing; `UserRetentionTest` walks first warning →
final warning → anonymisation with localized subjects, proves premium accounts are exempt, and
proves `anonymous@example.com` is still warned (the `anon!_%` escape - an unescaped `_` is an HQL
wildcard); `EmailFailureTest` injects an unreachable mailer as a CDI alternative and shows
registration still returns 200. No test touches SMTP. Manually verified against live Supabase +
Quarkus dev: registering with `Accept-Language: uk-UA` produced `users.language = uk` and a mock
mailer capture of "Ласкаво просимо до jZen", `en-US` produced `en` and "Welcome to jZen".

## ADR-001 — jZen is a framework; libraries (`server/`, `client/`) vs applications (`apps/`)

**Date:** 2026-07-19. **Status:** accepted.

### Decision

jZen is a **framework/platform**, not a single product. The repository is organised on that axis:

- **`server/`** — the Java **framework libraries** (`zen-proto`, `zen-core`, `zen-transport`,
  `zen-identity`, `zen-email`): plain-jar modules under the `zen-parent` reactor.
- **`client/`** — the Dart/Flutter **framework libraries** (`zen_core`, `zen_transport`,
  `zen_identity`, `zen_localization`, `zen_ui_*`): a pub workspace.
- **`apps/`** — full-stack **application examples/products** that assemble the framework, each a
  folder holding its client and server: `apps/<app>/{<app>_client, <app>_server}`. Today
  `apps/zen_demo/{zen_demo_client, zen_demo_server}`; next `apps/workspaces/{client, server}`.
- The **repository root stays language-neutral** — only `Taskfile.yml` orchestrates. No root
  `pom.xml`, no root `pubspec.yaml`. There are two Maven build units (framework libs; app servers)
  and two pub workspaces (framework libs; app clients), wired by the Taskfile.

### What this supersedes, and why

1. **"No `apps/` wrapper; a package is a package whether a library or the demo app"**
   (BLUEPRINT "Repository layout"; memory `jzen-migration-project`) → **reversed.**
   *Why:* the client tier is a 1-lib-set : N-apps relationship — `zen_demo`, `workspaces`, … all
   sharing `zen_core`/`zen_transport`/… That is exactly where separating `apps/` from a shared-lib
   `client/` earns its keep (it does not exist on the single-deployable server side), and it makes
   the layout symmetric with the framework.

2. **"`server/` holds `zen-proto/core/transport/identity/email/app`; `zen-app` is the runnable app
   among the libs"** (BLUEPRINT "Backend: why multi-module"; memory) → **changed.**
   `server/` is framework libraries only; the runnable app moved to `apps/zen_demo/zen_demo_server`
   (artifactId `zen-demo-server`, package `zen.demo`). *Why:* the app is an *assembly* of the
   framework and belongs with the applications; this removes the app-among-libs asymmetry and
   mirrors `client`(libs) ↔ `apps`(apps).
   *Maven mechanics ("no root pom"):* `server/pom.xml` remains `zen-parent` (BOM, Java version,
   plugin/dependency management) **and** aggregates + `install`s the libraries. App server modules
   inherit `zen-parent` across directories via `<relativePath>../../../server/pom.xml</relativePath>`
   and resolve the libraries from the local repository. The shared Maven wrapper is invoked with
   `-f` (`server/mvnw -f apps/…/pom.xml`), so no wrapper is duplicated. Verified: framework
   `install` → app `package` produces the runnable jar and passes all tests.
   *Dart mechanics:* `apps/pubspec.yaml` is a second workspace; its members path-depend into
   `client/` libraries that declare `resolution: workspace`. Verified: pub resolves the
   cross-workspace path-dep and imports compile across the boundary.

3. **"`AuthResource` lives in `zen-app`, not `zen-identity`, because zen-app owns the REST surface"**
   (BLUEPRINT "Authentication"; ROADMAP Step 3; memory) → **reversed.**
   The auth REST surface (`AuthResource`, `AuthExceptionMapper`) moved into `zen-identity`, a
   Jandex-indexed framework library. *Why:* jZen is a framework for *all* new apps; auth must be
   reusable so a new product (`workspaces`) inherits login/register/logout rather than reinventing
   it. Quarkus discovers JAX-RS resources from a Jandex-indexed jar; the app module still runs
   SmallRye OpenAPI and supplies the referenced component schemas via its static `openapi.yaml`
   (paths come from the library resource, schemas from the app). Verified: the auth endpoints are
   served from the library and all auth tests pass.

4. **"`dartzen_demo_server` is deleted; the Quarkus backend (`server/`) is the server now"; "zen_demo
   is the Flutter reference app"** (ROADMAP Step 4; memory) → **reframed.**
   `zen-app` was always the reference backend (an assembly of framework libs); it is *relocated*,
   not deleted, to `apps/zen_demo/zen_demo_server`. `zen_demo` is now a folder holding
   `{zen_demo_client, zen_demo_server}`. *Why:* the reference app demonstrates building a full-stack
   app on jZen (client **and** server), and because both sides assemble the framework it is a
   genuine **framework** end-to-end gate.

5. **"A green `zen_demo` run is *the* product release gate"** (ROADMAP Step 4) → **refined.**
   `task test:e2e` proves the *framework* composes end-to-end via the reference app; each product
   app (`workspaces`) gets its own e2e. *Why:* the framework model.

### Consequence

The framework identity is reflected in MANIFESTO/BLUEPRINT wording, the layout sections, and the
Taskfile's `:apps` task group. Lockstep versioning is unchanged: the `apps/` members
(`zen_demo_client`, `zen-demo-server`, `apps/pubspec.yaml`) share the `0.1.0` product version.

## ADR-002 — Server i18n uses Qute `@MessageBundle`, not `.properties`

**Date:** 2026-07-19. **Status:** accepted.

**Decision.** Server-side localized messages are typed Qute `@MessageBundle` interfaces
(`DemoMessages` + a `@Localized("uk")` variant), selected per request. The reusable, framework-free
`Accept-Language` → locale resolution lives in `zen.core.i18n.AcceptLanguage` (a pure function,
reused by any module). Localized *documents* (the terms Markdown) stay as classpath `.md` files -
content, not messages.

**Supersedes** the interim Step-4 choice of a hand-rolled `.properties`-backed `DemoMessages` bean.
*Why:* `@MessageBundle` is the Quarkus-idiomatic, typed, generated mechanism and the direction
ROADMAP step 6 (localized email) already commits to; a third, hand-rolled l10n format was needless,
and locale resolution belongs in a shared framework utility, not a demo-local bean.

---

## ADR-003 — HTTP status codes: an extendable constant interface

**Date:** 2026-07-19. **Status:** accepted.

**Decision.** `@APIResponse(responseCode = …)` values reference `zen.core.http.ZenStatus`, an
**interface** of `public static final String` codes that jZen applications may `extends` to add
their own (e.g. `interface AppStatus extends ZenStatus { String PAYMENT_REQUIRED = "402"; }`).
*Reference or `extends` it; never `implements` it* (Effective Java Item 22, the constant-interface
antipattern).

**Supersedes** raw `"200"`/`"204"` literals in the resources. *Why:* centralization and
extensibility for jZen customers. A wrapper deriving the strings from Jakarta's `Response.Status`
is impossible for annotation use: an annotation value must be a *constant expression* (JLS 15.29),
and `String.valueOf(Status.OK.getStatusCode())` is a method call, not a constant (verified: it
fails "element value must be a constant expression"). A literal is the only annotation-legal form,
so these are documented literals; an *extended constant interface* keeps them compile-time constants
(verified to compile as annotation values).

---

## ADR-004 — Client (Flutter) i18n: keep `zen_localization` now, adopt typed/generated later

**Date:** 2026-07-19. **Status:** deferred (revisit as a framework decision).

**Context.** Server i18n went typed and generated (ADR-002, Qute `@MessageBundle`). The Flutter side
currently uses `zen_localization` — a hand-rolled service over per-locale JSON bundles with **string
keys** looked up at runtime. That is the `easy_localization` camp (stringly-typed), *not* the
idiomatic Flutter approach.

**What "idiomatic Flutter" is.** The Flutter/Google-recommended path is the `intl` package + **ARB**
files (`.arb`) + `flutter gen-l10n`, which *generates a typed `AppLocalizations`* class
(compile-checked keys, no runtime string lookups). The popular type-safe third-party alternative is
**`slang`** (generates typed accessors from JSON/YAML). *Effective Dart*'s ethos — typed over
stringly-typed — points the same way. So the consistent end state is **typed + generated on both
stacks**: `@MessageBundle` (Quarkus) ↔ `intl`/`gen-l10n` or `slang` (Flutter).

**Decision (deferred).** Keep `zen_localization` for now. It is a Step-2 **framework library**, so
changing it is a framework-wide decision larger than the app work that surfaced this, and it is not
on the critical path. **Recorded for a future step:** evaluate migrating `zen_localization` (or the
apps that consume it) to `intl`/`gen-l10n` or `slang` for a type-safe, generated client i18n that
mirrors the server's `@MessageBundle`. Not lost — parked here deliberately.

---

## ADR-005 — Admin panel: a framework scaffold + per-app panels; framework CRUD resource; bare-array pagination

**Date:** 2026-07-20. **Status:** accepted.

### Decision

Three coupled choices for the Step-5 admin (`admin/`), made to keep the panel consistent with the
framework/apps split (ADR-001):

1. **Split scaffold from panel.** The reusable react-admin machinery is a **framework scaffold**,
   `@jzen/admin-core` (kept at top-level `admin/`): a credentialed data provider wired to jZen's
   `Content-Range` pagination, an auth provider backed by the framework's Supabase session, and a
   login page — all type-generic (bound to no app's schema). Each app assembles it into its **own
   panel** under `apps/<app>/<app>_admin`, which registers domain `<Resource>`s and owns its
   generated `openapi-typescript` schema. Today: `apps/zen_demo/zen_demo_admin`. This mirrors
   `client/`(framework libs) ↔ `apps/`(app clients) on the TypeScript tier.

2. **The users CRUD resource is a framework resource.** `AdminUserResource`
   (`GET`/`PUT /api/v1/admin/users`) lives in `zen-identity`, beside `AuthResource`, `User`, and
   `RoleAugmentor` — the auth precedent (ADR-001 pt.3). It is `@RolesAllowed("admin")`, so every
   app's admin inherits user administration rather than reinventing it. Its wire type is a new
   `AdminUser` message in `proto/zen/v1/admin.proto` (component schema merged via the app's static
   `META-INF/openapi.yaml`, TA-1).

3. **List endpoints return a bare JSON array + `Content-Range`**, the stock `ra-data-simple-rest`
   convention, rather than a wrapper proto. Each element is still the declared `AdminUser` proto,
   rendered with `JsonFormat` (proto3 canonical JSON, zero-valued fields kept for a stable key
   set); the array is composed in the resource. This needs **no** `List<Message>` body writer and
   leaves the transport seam untouched. `Content-Range`/`Accept-Ranges` are added to the app's CORS
   `exposed-headers` so a cross-origin panel can read the total. Because the admin is JSON-only, the
   list endpoint is `application/json` only (the get/update endpoints keep the dual-transport
   `Response`-wraps-proto TA-1 form).

**Linking mechanism.** The per-app panel imports the scaffold **from source** via a TypeScript
`paths` alias + a Vite `resolve.alias` (with `dedupe` of `react`/`react-admin`), **not** a pnpm
dependency edge. This is the source-level analog of the Dart `path:` dep into `client/` and the
Maven `<relativePath>` inheritance: it keeps the repository root language-neutral (no root
`pnpm-workspace.yaml`), gives the app the single copy of React, and avoids a build/publish step for
the scaffold.

### What this supersedes, and why

- **"Flesh out `admin/` (the react-admin app)"** (ROADMAP Step 5; MANIFESTO/BLUEPRINT/STANDARDS
  wording that treated `admin/` as *the* app) → **refined.** `admin/` is now the framework scaffold
  `@jzen/admin-core`; the runnable panel is `apps/zen_demo/zen_demo_admin`. *Why:* an admin panel is
  a client of a specific app's backend, so per ADR-001 the reusable parts are a framework library
  and the assembly is an app. Docs and the Taskfile (`DEMO_ADMIN_DIR`, repointed
  `deps/build/test/run/generate` admin tasks, the `generate:types` openapi path) are updated to match.
- **"reuse `PageRequest` for list requests"** (Step-5 brief) → **not used on this path.** The
  ra-data-simple-rest convention passes `range`/`sort`/`filter` as query params, not a request body,
  so there is no request message to declare; `PageRequest` (common.proto) stays available for
  body-paged endpoints elsewhere.

### Consequence

Lockstep versioning holds: `@jzen/admin-core` and `@jzen/zen-demo-admin` are `0.1.0`. A second app
gets its own `apps/<app>/<app>_admin` assembling the same scaffold, and any admin resource that is
domain-specific (rather than identity) lands in that app's server, while identity administration
stays framework-side. Verified: `task build:admin`/`test:admin` green across the two-package
source-link; `AdminUserResourceTest` (7 tests) covers the role gate, `Content-Range` pagination, a
role filter, the get/update round-trip, and the `ZenError` not-found path.

---

## ADR-006 — Java namespace realignment: `dev.zen` → bare `zen`

**Date:** 2026-07-20. **Status:** accepted.

### Decision

The Java package root and Maven `groupId` are **bare `zen`**, not the reverse-DNS `dev.zen`:
`groupId zen`, packages `zen.core` / `zen.transport` / `zen.identity` / `zen.demo` / …, and every
proto now emits `option java_package = "zen.proto.v1"` **derived from** its own `package zen.v1`
rather than overriding it to `dev.zen.proto.v1`.

### What this supersedes, and why

- **`groupId dev.zen`, `package dev.zen.*`, `java_package "dev.zen.proto.v1"`** (Steps 0-4) →
  **renamed** repo-wide to `zen`. *Why (three reasons, one direction):*
  1. **The Zen source convention.** BugEater — the backend jZen is harvested from — uses a
     **bare brand namespace**: `groupId jlogicsoftware`, `package jlogicsoftware.*`, no reverse-DNS
     prefix, sliced by feature. jZen's `dev.` prefix departed from that for no stated reason.
  2. **Internal consistency.** Everything else in jZen is already bare `zen`: the canonical proto
     `package zen.v1`, the Dart libraries `zen_core`/`zen_transport`/…, the Maven artifacts
     `zen-core`/`zen-identity`/`zen-parent`. Only the Java package and `groupId` carried `dev.`, and
     the protos even overrode their own `package zen.v1` to `dev.zen.proto.v1` — a `zen.v1` ↔
     `dev.zen` mismatch baked into the contract layer.
  3. **The MANIFESTO.** "The contract is the single source of truth." The contract declares
     `package zen.v1`; the Java namespace must *follow* it (`zen.proto.v1`), not invent a different
     root. `dev.zen` (reverse-DNS for a `zen.dev` domain that is not the brand — the brand is
     jZen / jZenDev) contradicted all three.

### Mechanics

A literal `dev.zen` → `zen` replacement across all `.java`, `.proto`, `pom.xml`,
`application.properties` (the log category `"dev.zen"` → `"zen"`; the `%dev.` profile prefix is
untouched), plus moving each module's `src/**/java/dev/zen` to `src/**/java/zen`, then
`task generate:proto`. The Dart generated code is unaffected (it keys off the proto `package zen.v1`,
which did not change) — verified: the existing `*.pb.dart` are byte-identical after regeneration, and
the OpenAPI schema/TS types are likewise unchanged (schema names, not Java packages).

### Consequence

Verified green after the rename: framework `install`, the app package, and the full backend suite
(23 tests across `zen.demo.*`), plus `task test:admin`/`build:admin`. Stale `dev.zen` artifacts in
the local `~/.m2` are harmless. Prior ADRs' `dev.zen.*` references (e.g. ADR-003's
`zen.core.http.ZenStatus`) now read as `zen.*`.
